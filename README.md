#Airbnb EDA
The Airbnb services provide people an easy,relatively stress-free way to earn some income for the hosts from their property as well as for the customers such as home benefits,personalized services,authenticity and social connection around the world.Thus it has curated a large dataset having both dependent and Independent variables.

In this EDA Project,we were provided with only one dataset which consists of approximately 49000 rows and 16 columns. We given alias for the dataset as df.

For the first step,we performed data wrangling over the raw data and concluded what are the features or columns should be used or dropped. Since the columns last_review and reviews_per_month has most of the null values,we have to either drop or replace the values.
We faced some challenges along the way as some price values given zero in which we replaced with median price on the basis of room_type and neighbourhood_group.

We divided the analysis part into two variates such as univariate and multvariate analysis for clear evaluation of conclusion and also for visualization.

Some of the univariate analysis that has been done for evaluating are top 10 host IDs that owns the maximum number of airbnbs,Distribution of the airbnbs in the neighbourhood groups,Distribution of Airbnbs on the basis of room_types.

Some of the multivariate analysis that has been done for evaluating are Comparison of neighbourhood_group in terms of price,Average availability of Airbnbs on the basis of neighbourhood groups and room types,Correlation of every features and so on.
The analysis are evaluated using various type of graphs and plots such as scatter plot,bar graph,violin plot etc.
The conclusion that we have derived can be used to implement business decision,understanding customer and provider behaviors,guiding marketing initiatives and implementing innovations and so on.
